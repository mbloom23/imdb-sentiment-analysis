# imdb-sentiment-analysis

This project builds a recurrent neural network (RNN) in order to perform sentiment analysis on the iMDB movie review dataset, classifying reviews as positive or negative. The RNN is implemented with both LSTM and GRU modules, and a variety of different modeling choices can be made, including the optimizer used during training, the depth of the network, the dimension of the word embeddings, and the size of the hidden dimension. By experimenting with these choices, an accuracy of about 89% was achieved on the test set.
